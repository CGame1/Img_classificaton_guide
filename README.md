# Cross-Validation with YOLO


Welcome! This repo provides access to a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to implement cross-validation with YOLO for image classification in Python. üì∑üåäüêôü§ñ

The notebook is designed to be beginner-friendly, with the option to run it entirely online using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CGame1/img-_classification_guide/blob/main/CrossVal_with_Yolo_colab.ipynb) ‚Äî no installation or GPU required.

If you're more comfortable with Python and Jupyter, you can also download or clone the notebook from [GitHub](https://github.com/CGame1) and run it locally. No data is required, as the code also downloads an open-source [dataset](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.949920), see [Meyer et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063722002333#da0010) for details.

This resource is a supplement to our paper: _[ADD Title]_.
