# Cross-Validation with YOLO


Welcome! This repo provides access to a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to implement cross-validation with YOLO for image classification in Python. üì∑üåäüêôü§ñ

The notebook is designed to be beginner-friendly, with the option to run it entirely online using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CGame1/Img_classificaton_guide/blob/main/notebooks/CrossVal_with_Yolo_colab.ipynb) ‚Äî no installation or GPU required.

If you're more comfortable with Python and Jupyter, you can also clone the repository and run it locally. No data is required, as the code also downloads an open-source [dataset](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.949920), see [Meyer et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063722002333#da0010) for details.

This resource is a supplement to our paper: _[ADD Title]_ (see below).

To deploy trained YOLO models, from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) for example, on new data, see code [here](). 

For R users, a shiny app is also available [here]() to provide the option to locally format data, with a base workflow they can customize.

Figure 1: Simplified and idealized diagram of an image classification scenario. Each box represents a key task and corresponds to a section of the paper to aid comprehension.  While presented largely linearly for clarity, real-world ML workflows are often iterative and non-linear and the need to revisit specific sections may vary depending on the scenario.
