# Cross-Validation with YOLO


Welcome! This repo provides access to a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to implement cross-validation with YOLO for image classification in Python. üì∑üåäüêôü§ñ

The notebook is designed to be beginner-friendly, with the option to run it entirely online using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CGame1/Img_classificaton_guide/blob/main/notebooks/CrossVal_with_Yolo_colab.ipynb) ‚Äî no installation or GPU required. However, if you're more comfortable with Python and Jupyter, you can also clone the repository and run it locally. 

No data is required, as the code also downloads an open-source [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CGame1/schulz_bank_biotopes) from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/). Note that this is a copy of the original [dataset](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.949920) (for faster access), see [Meyer et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063722002333#da0010) for details.

The notebook also contains code to deploy trained YOLO models, from Hugging Face for example, on new data

*For R users*: A shiny app (and associated R code) is also available [here](https://github.com/Npiechaud/Benthic-Images-CV/tree/main/shiny_app) for select tasks.
